Score: (5/5)

Nice job. However, the call to `Landmark.find_by` in `show.html.erb`, and `Landmark.all` in `index.html.erb` should both be 
instead done from the `LandmarksController` (in the `show` and `index` methods, respectively), not from the view! 

An alternative to defining all that landmark data in your model file would be to include it in a separate `yml`
file, and import it into `landmark.rb`. 

Minor note, but careful to double check casing on your file names! The `C` in `landmarks_Controller.rb` should be lower case.

REVISED:
Adding back 1 point taken off for not retrieving data from the controller.
